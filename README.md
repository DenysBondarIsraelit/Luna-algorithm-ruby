The Luhn algorithm is an algorithm for calculating the check digit of a plastic card number in accordance with ISO / IEC 7812. It is not a cryptographic tool, but is intended primarily to detect errors caused by unintentional data distortion (for example, when manually entering a number card when receiving social security number information over the phone). Allows only with some degree of certainty to judge the absence of errors in the block of numbers, but does not give the possibility of finding and correcting the detected inaccuracies.


for example:

valid number card is 4111 1111 1111 1234

invalid number card  4111 1111 1111 1235
